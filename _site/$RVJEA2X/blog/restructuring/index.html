        Moving Away From Daily Articles <div class="datebox"> 09 September 2024</div>
      </div>
      <div class="maintext">
        <p>This site, if you haven't noticed, gets articles more or less daily, but to be honest, I don't know if that's the ideal way to operate. I'm able to write reasonably fast, but, I won't deny the fact that my daily works are shorter than my longer, more informational works (like my computer reviews).</p>
<p>I do believe that the bulk of this site's views came from my shorter article, but, I'm conflicted as to if I should keep rolling a dice on if a daily article will be good, or if I should just bite the bullet and make long form content that takes a few days. I won't deny that it is kinda nice having the 'daily articles' caption, but honestly, a lot of what I publish isn't that good.</p>
<p>As such, it is my intention to transition this site towards more constructive works that a bit longer, as I can only really rant on for so long before I get bored. If you do for some reason feel strongly one way or the other, please do comment, I mean it probably won't change my mind, but it'd be funny to look at.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to write about watches for awhile, so I guess that'll be what I publish next, probably later this week. I'm also in the middle of a site rework, as I mentioned before, it should be up later this week, but I've been busy as of late, so no promises. Sorry that the schizo ramblings aren't daily anymore, but you also get more sentences of schizo ramblings, so it's a net gain. TM out.</p>
