	<ul class="posttextcontent">I think a lot of people, including myself, were under the impression that computer literacy would only go up with every generation, but as of late I&#39;ve been seeing the opposite. In hindsight it&#39;s probably really obvious why this is, but I&#39;m sure as hell gonna write about it anyways.</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">Another trademarkhell.net article praising obsolete technology? Who could&#39;ve seen that coming. I believe that CRTs haven&#39;t been mathced in quality by modern LCDs, and in this article I try to justify my increasingly unpopular take.</ul>

I&#39;ll post a proper article tomorrow, but I&#39;ve been meaning to do something like this.</ul>

	<ul class="posttextcontent">Discord has somehow replaced just about every niche forum that once existed, and this mildly annoys me. This annoyance doesn&#39;t actually justify an article, but trademarkhell.net isn&#39;t about justification. Discord shot and killed my favorite forum, more on the article, click it, or else something may happen.</ul>

	<ul class="posttextcontent">English is a lot more historically and grammatically interesting than you may think. Nobody really cares about this, for good reason, but I&#39;m here to be that one person who cares. This is just me rambling on about what I think makes English such a cool language. (plus you&#39;re reading it in English..)</ul>

	<ul class="posttextcontent">Technology in the modern era seems to have the uncanny ability to start being terrible to use after a few years, and I wanted to write about what likely causes that.

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">If you haven&#39;t noticed, this site has been posting daily for the past few weeks, this was in part because I felt like it, and in part because I wanted to conduct an experiment. I saw many sites towards the top of Nekoweb&#39;s most following which were visually impressive, but often lacking in content, so I wanted to try making a site that was the opposite.</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">Fulfilling my obligation to write a serious article. This is a semi-informational piece on the PC-98 line of computers. I&#39;m pretty happy with how this turned out, but it has an unfortunate lack of deranged rambling. I&#39;ll add that in a later revision, make sure to look for that, coming 2028.</ul>

		<time class="postlist-date" datetime="2024-08-26"> // 26 August 2024</time>
	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">I was looking at my previous anime reviews and realized they kinda sucked, so before trying one of those again, I wanted to write an article on a phenomenon I&#39;ve found interesting as of late. Anime has somehow gone from a generic dweeb 4chan basement dweller interest to a (relatively) socially acceptable hobby. This article mostly covers my thoughts as to why I believe this shift happened. PC-98 article tomorrow... fr fr..</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">Everyday, I&#39;m almost certain you think &quot;Wow, I see so many easily stereotyped groups on the indie web but I&#39;m not brave enough to categorize them.&quot; I&#39;m here to be the brave knight in shining warrior who&#39;ll stereotype entire broad groups of people, just as the lord intended. This article is *mostly* satire, but based off of genuine obervations.</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">AI does a lot of awful things, and I fully recognize this, but I also feel as though many people are under a false premonition as to what AI can/will be able to do. This article is basically just my thoughts on AI as a whole, and why I think it does have a lot of valid use cases in medical/science research.</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">If you&#39;re reading this article, odds are you use Neocities or Nekoweb as a webhost, but that got me thinking. What is it that made these webhosts so popular? I still have no idea, and I don&#39;t really feel like doing actual research, so instead I provide unproven theories. This is another Harvard worthy article, I reckon.</ul>

		<time class="postlist-date" datetime="2024-08-22"> // 22 August 2024</time>
	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">If you have an entire site dedicated to yourself and your opinions, you&#39;re egotistical. Despite this, I don&#39;t believe egotism to be an inherently bad thing. This is a rather strange take, so I won&#39;t try to compress it down further here, but read the article if you want, it&#39;s rather short compared to some of my other posts.</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">The Indie Web doesn&#39;t exactly have a formal rulebook for good practice, and that&#39;s for good reason, you can do whatever you want. However, I still feel as though there&#39;s a few things people should know before getting into making their first site or a new site. (yes this article mentions SSGs again, no i&#39;m not sorry)</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">As a brief break from my plentiful unhinged rants, I instead present a rant about my favorite piece of technology, the IBM 5160. It&#39;s useless in the modern era, but man is it cool, and I&#39;ve been tinkering with one long enough that I owe it an article. I can&#39;t really think of any other ways to market this article.. read it if you like scrap metal, I guess.</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">My IBM 5160 article is taking longer than I thought it would, and I&#39;ve been on a roll with random website articles, so I figured I&#39;d keep the trend going. I kinda think about me sections are pointless on personal sites, and in this article I use extremely pretentious reasoning to justify my opinion on the subject.

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">If you haven&#39;t noticed by the fact I&#39;ve been posting articles daily, I have something of a computer addiction, and odds are, if you&#39;re on this site, you use your computer far more than the average person. This article is my extremely unscientific analysis of the phenomenon of computer addiction. I assume that Harvard will be publishing this soon.</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">Just yesterday I recognized that my web and article sections were nearly identical, unfortunately, this will be keeping that trend going, as I&#39;ll be ranting about web design elements I dislike. This article is solely based on my opinions, and the evidence used is fringe at best. Deeply scientific stuff.</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">As I was adding the &#39;web&#39; tag to my site I realized that my web section and blog section were identical, so I figured I should talk about something new. Here it is, an article about shoddily put together vehicles predominently owned by secondary school students. I literally have no idea who will read this, it sounded more interesting in my head. This article has no real meaning, and there&#39;ll still be another article today.</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">I like to think that I&#39;ve seen a reasonable amount of personal sites, and in large part, I think they&#39;re awesome. However, I can&#39;t help but notice that some people may take the personal part a little too seriously.. maybe don&#39;t say  &quot;My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque New Mexico 87104.&quot; on the front page. This article is basically just my excuse to ramble about the importance of internet privacy.</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">Welcome to the N.H.K. is far from the best show I&#39;ve watched, and quite frankly, I doubt I&#39;ll ever be in the right mental state to watch it again. Despite this, it impacted me more than any other piece of media I&#39;ve consumed in my life, and I suspect it could have a similar effect on many people in a similar position to where I once was.</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul class="posttextcontent">Throughout my brief stint in the brainrot/Indie Web community, I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of people seem to be heavily opposed to the use of static site generators, seemingly feeling as though the use of one would make their site less legitimate.

	<ul class="posttextcontent">Weebs nowadays have to endure countless low quality isekai adaptions as the generic seasonal Anime of choice. In the 2000s, however, light novel adaptions were the new fad of the time, which brought countless pieces of seasonal shows that nobody remembers, and, also, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya anime adaption, a masterpiece characterized by absurdity and jokes that probably don&#39;t land for the majority of people watching it today.</ul>
