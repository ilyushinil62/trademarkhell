          <p>If you look around on Nekoweb, which is filled with artists, you'll inevitably see a lot of webmasters strongly opposed to AI in it's entirety. I feel as though this perspective is inherently flawed, however, for the AI you use to cheat on homework, make low quality anime girls, and roleplay with is very different from the AI that is allowing scientific and medical research to be done at a rate faster than ever before, thanks to machine learning.</p>
<p>I find it ignorant to consider the entirety of AI to be this terrible thing, when, in practice, it is one of man's greatest innovations of recent years. It's fundamentally changing the way research on cancer and other diseases is being approached (i am not citing stuff on &quot;trademarkhell.net&quot; but here's a link https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/artificial-intelligence). If the cost of better understanding a disease that's stumped researchers is some crappy AI generated art, then I think that's worth it.</p>
<p>I also see a lot of people which (justifiably) dislike AI due to the inherent belief that it will take human jobs. In my eyes, however, this is simply improbable for the majority of jobs, because governments will likely pass regulations forbidding it. Governments would end up being the people having to deal with the homeless cleanup, unemployment checks, and reduction in tax income, and believe it or not, they don't want to.</p>
<p>AI in and of itself has already begun to become a buzzword similar to what happened with NFTs and a lot of cryptocurrencies. I think the most likely outcome will be that it simply becomes a tool for research (and larping...) like any other, albiet far more efficient. So, no, your thriving job as an artist in which you depict catgirls 7/11 parking lots will likely not be at risk, nobody really wants an AI version..</p>
<p>It's just another product of a constantly changing era that we'll have to adapt to, nothing more, nothing less. It's foolish to feel as though this'll be the end of all jobs and art as a whole. Sure, some fields may change to a degree, but I doubt that it'll be the radical shift that some people suspect it to be. TM out.</p>
