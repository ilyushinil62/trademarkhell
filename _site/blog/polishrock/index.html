        Top ten worst  interests; Polish Rock <div class="datebox"> 11 August 2024</div>

        <p>As a terminally online individual, who's life revolves around a select group of internet forums and Discord servers, it's my duty to exclusively maintain interests  that are either solely maintained by terminally online people, or maintained by 2.5 people total. As this website probably indicates, I've fulfilled this requirement quite well, and today I'll be talking about one of the stranger ones. Polish Rock.</p>
<p>A few years ago I played through the game 'SUPERHOT', the most innovative shooter I've played in years, but this isn't about SUPERHOT, rather, it's about the song that played in it's credits, &quot;Psy Pawłowa&quot;, by Republika.</p>

<p>In hindsight, this is honestly one of the weaker songs on Republika's discography, but I think it's important for the rabbithole it led me down. It effectively made me realize that music I couldn't understand was actually pretty good, and opened the floodgates of Polish rock to me, as opposed to the same few Chinese and Japanese songs I was listening to at the time.</p>
<p>Ironically, I still have no real interest in learning Polish, but, I have continued to discover many more bands and songs hailing from Poland. Just to list off a few, Turbo has a pretty strong discography, with nearly all the songs from their '00 album &quot;Remix 92&quot; sounding really good, and Kazik na Żywo has a really good collection of grunge-esque songs, albeit, the mastering on some of them leaves something to be desired (also pretty similar to grunge songs of the era...)</p>
<p>Republika has still remained my favorite of the Polish bands I've heard, perhaps because they were the first, or perhaps due to the sheer number of songs they have. My favorites are easily &quot;Fast (New)&quot;, and &quot;Raz na milion lat&quot;. The latter of which is one of my favorite songs of all time.</p>
<p>Now, despite this article largely being about my dumb interests and such, I would like for the 0.5 people reading this to at least consider listening to music from regions and languages outside of where they reside. It can be a really interesting experience, and if you're lucky (or unlucky), you may actually like the music. Anyways, that's it for today's rambling session, thanks for coming. Leave your bingoboards where you picked them up.</p>
