          <p>Breakcore, the official genre of 20-something NEETs that describe themselves as &quot;lainpilled femcels&quot; and use PFPs of Tomoko from WataMote in their extremist political Discords. This genre (according to the reputable source of Wikipedia) traces it's routes to the mid 90s, stemming from jungle, drum and bass, and other relatively small gneres, however, this form of Breakcore is so detached from what many consider to be modern Breakcore that I'll be skipping to the 2000s.</p>
<p>Alright, picture this, it's the late 2000s, you have to pick between three CDs, first, we have the objectively good CD, &quot;Graduation&quot; by Kanye West, with it's bright album art, but obviously, you won't pick this one, because you're here on this article. Beside it, you have &quot;Detrimentalist&quot; by Venetian Snares, which dawns fittingly complex album art, and &quot;tomboyish love for daughter&quot; by Goreshit, which featurees album art that is likely illegal in several regions. The latter two, in my opinion, represent the two quintessential Breakcore albums of the 2000s that led to the two branching Breakcore sub-genres that we see today.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you're thinking &quot;what tf makes thse albums important&quot; and &quot;wtf is that goreshit album art.&quot; I'll get to the first point briefly, but the album art is, you guessed it, cropped Touhou hentai. This is truly a genre defined by it's classiness and maturity. Now, back to the first point, these albums, whilst quite good, are arguably most important due to the cultural split they caused in breakcore. Take this song from Goreshit's album, titled &quot;strawberry cheesecake&quot;:</p>

<p>And then compare it to this song, &quot;Gentlemen&quot; by Venetian Snares:</p>

<p>These songs, despite both being Breakcore, due to their usage of the Amen Break, arguably couldn't be any more different. Goreshit leans heavily towards sampling sounds and music from Anime, a trend that continues today in Breakcore through artists such as Rori in early 20s, and to a limited degree, through Sewerslvt's works (although it can be argued that the majority of her music isn't breakcore, and I largely agree with this). The latter represents a more traditional form of Breakcore, which is the other side of the modern Breakcore coin, being evident through artists such as Machine Girl, and once again, to a lesser extent, Nanoray.</p>
<p>I personally enjoy both genres of Breakcore, being a terminally online individual, but the point of this article wasn't really to say that &quot;yeah i kinda like breakcore lol&quot;, but rather, to demonstrate the sheer variety of Breakcore artists and songs. Many people do disregard Breakcore, for good reason, but for those that haven't already, listen to some, you'll probably like at least some of it, unless you don't, in which case, it's not my problem.</p>
