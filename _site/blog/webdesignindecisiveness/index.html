        Indecisiveness and Web Design <div class="datebox"> 26 September 2024</div>
      </div>
      <div class="maintext">
        <p>If you haven't noticed by the fact that this website gets completely rebranded every month or two, I'm rather indecisive. I doubt it's just me, though, I mean I see plenty of sites get updated an absurd amount, and the 4,282 scrapped layouts that my friends make.</p>
<p>Webdesign is sort of a trap, in that by just publishing a layout, you'll immediately notice every flaw it has. Besides, you like doing web development, so you'll just remake it anyways, and so the cycle continues.</p>
<p>The current layout you're looking at is the result of weeks of (off and on) work, and quite frankly, I don't like it at all. Everything on this site was the result of a concious decision, and yet, juat a week after publishing it, I've &quot;decided&quot; to not like it.</p>
<p>I honestly think it may be impossible to fully decide on a layout, or even a style, unless you make it as bland and inoffensive as possible. That's not to say that this is a good thing, but honestly, I think it's what'll come in the near future for me.</p>
<img src="/img/nixonmaxxing.png" alt="A deeply profound Discord conversation." width="550px"  style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>
<p>I put this so eloquently in a Discord conversation with someone who's name I won't bother to obscure, since it's some stupid esoteric nickname anyways.</p>
<p>To be honest, though, I think there's a beauty in a site that's simple and long-lasting. The backend of this site is genuinely atrocious, I think nearly all the stylesheets are over 500 lines, and that makes me want to simplify the site along with the stylesheets.</p>
<p>It's not a bad thing to always be changing layouts in some indecisive frenzy, but I don't think contentment will ever be reached until you make something absurdly simple and easy to tolerate.</p>
<p>I've always liked creative site designs, but by the end of November, there's no way this site isn't some soulless Helvetica font using, mobile-responsive, grey/white themed thing. Remember this article as the one that killed trademarkhell.net, I guess, but also consider that there's more to having a website than re-styling it every week. TM out.</p>
