        <p>As a guy from the middle of nowhere, it's a mandate that you get into one of two hobbies before you graduate high school, drugs or cars. I don't think cocaine lets you run as fast as a car, so I ultimately went with the latter.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, though, I owe a weird amount to cars, even if they just seem to be an abritary mode of transportation.</p>
<p>My first car was a 1994 Mazda Miata in god-awful condition that I bought with the random savings I had procured as a sixteen year old. I don't think there was a single good quality about this vehicle, but I honestly think I learned more from it than I had from anything else beforehand.</p>
<p>The exhaust pipe rusted out, so I learned to weld, the power steering rack failed, so I learned how to install a manual one, the head gasket blew, so I learned to disassemble the block, along with a myriad of other issues. I had literally zero interest in learning any of this beforehand, yet, because I wanted to have a car, I learned.</p>
<p>I honestly think the mechanical sympathy and knowledge obtained by owning a (usually shitty) car can't be accidentally obtained in any other way.</p>
<p>That's not even to mention the community aspects, I've made some of the best friends I have today just because I went to car meets at ungodly hours and did sketchy bolt-on modifications to my car.</p>
<p>There's little to no practical reason for cars to exist in many areas today, particularly given the advancements in public transportation. But quite frankly, I'll hold on to my god-awful project cars until I can't. Is it efficient? No, absolutely not. But there will never be a feeling like driving a car &quot;built&quot; by you that behaves in a way you can perfectly predict--it's probably the closest you can get to being &quot;one with the machine.&quot; TM Out.</p>
