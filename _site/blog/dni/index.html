        <p>I'm mo one of those people who actually look through personal sites, and generally speaking, what I see doesn't surprise me all that much, but one phenomenon on personal sites has always stood out to me: The DNI List.</p>
<p>The Do Not Interact, or DNI, As I'll be abbreviating it, List, for those somehow not aware, is effectively a list of categories of people that you don't want to interact with (hence the name). On it's own, this seems like a pretty rationale, but what I think some people fail to realize is the effect this list will actually have on their site.</p>
<p>Listing off the types of people you don't want to interact with on your site is the digital equivalent of putting political stickers on your car, and similar to how that car will get keyed, your site's guestbook will get spammed. Human nature dictates that if you say you don't like something, the offended group will proceed to make you like them even less (I assume Freud said this or something...).</p>
<p>That's not to say you shouldn't have your own opinions on others, but maybe don't make a convenient bulleted list that people can check themselves off of. If you want to get people you don't want to associate with off your site, then maybe use your site for what you believe in, as opposed to what you don't. Someone's a lot less likely to mess with you if they disagree with you than if they feel &quot;targeted&quot; by you.</p>
<p>That's all to say that the last thing a DNI will do is keep people from interacting with you, but if you want &quot;pro-shippers&quot; or whatever the current subject of autistic discourse is in your guestbook, than go for it, I guess.. TM out.</p>
