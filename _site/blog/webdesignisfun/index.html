        Web Design is Kinda Fun? <div class="datebox"> 08 September 2024</div>

      <div class="maintext">
        <p>I unfortunately had to endure my apartment being painted for the past few days, which meant I couldn't use my computer. I initially thought this would be nice as I spend 99% of my computer time annoyed at VSCode, but I was actually pretty bored. This got me thinking, maybe web design is actually sorta fun.</p>
<p>I'm not going to pretend to be a webdeveloper or anything, I'm not, I'm some rando who learned basic html and css a few months ago, but for me at least, this is pretty enjoyable. I Think a big part of what makes amateur hobbies in a lot of fields so fun is that you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.</p>
<p>99% of what I spent my time doing when making this site version was consulting MDN Web Docs for stuff I should already know, yet for some reason, whenever something little actually worked, I was irrationally happy about it. Shitty web design is more or less just small victory after small victory, because you have no idea what you're doing.</p>
<p>Regrettably, I actually realize everything that's wrong with this site version now, and I'm in the process of redesigning it, but even that's fun, as it's becoming increasingly evident what I've learned. I guess as long as you're stupid enough, anything can be fun, even if that's staring blankly at MDN Web Docs for a full weekend.</p>
<p>If you actually do understand the principles of web development, I'm sorry for your loss, that must be terribly boring, but also, GIWTWM. For everyone else, keep at the struggle, it's pretty fun. TM out. (you should still learn how to make a proper site; don't be like me)</p>
