Nekopology

10 December 1238

Dresden, Germany

It is I, Trademarkhell.net. I've come back for the first time in about a month, not to actually make a blog post, but to publish a formal recognition of my sins against the Nekoweb Discord Church. I'm a changed man; I'm a different man than I was 13 hours ago. I've repented; I can see where I've gone astray.

To sin is to be human, and to be a sinner is to be destined to end up in Heaven. In fact, it's been said time and time again that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, in other words, actions contrary to sin. Every single action I took in Nekoweb was done with bad intentions, and as such, will land me in Heaven. Is it really fair to deny a man destined to go to Heaven entry to Nekoweb?

To provide a parallel that may be easier to understand, allow me to use an example from Arthur Miller's The Crucible. This play follows John Proctor, a brilliant man who just happened to cheat on his wife several times, yet, even months after this happened, his wife refused to forgive him, John Proctor having evidently "mistaken you [Elizabeth Proctor] for God that day" (Miller 55). In this position, the Nekoweb Discord Church is the bitchy wife, and I'm the based, awesome, etc., main character who may have slipped up just a little.

The Crucible isn't merely falsely interpreting the morals of Christianity; Ephesians 4:32 states that we must "And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you" (KJV Bible, Ephesians. 4:32). I've taken 40-50 actions that could be dubiously considered mistakes, and yet, I was banned for this. The Bible clearly states that I should be forgiven of all my sins (Nekoweb Warnings) immediately, and yet, this hasn't happened.

As such, I implore you (@<265655616230522883> on Discord) to accept my apology. It seems that you have not yet applied Catholic reasoning into your moderation processes, and I can understand why; not all have been enlightened by the Lord's word. I implore you to do so, though, for this will most certainly change your life for the better.

Best,

TM
