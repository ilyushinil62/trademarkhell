title: The Politicization of Internet Spaces
description: As of late, the fashionable thing to do seems to be to proudly display your political beliefs or thoughts on middle eastern conflicts in your username or bio, as though it's a campaign bumper sticker. In typical trademarkhell.net fashion, I'll vaguely go over this and provide zero evidnece.

Allow me to preface this post with one thing, the writings here are in no way intended to influence nor attack your political beliefs, in fact, I couldn't care less about them. Rather, I'm writing about how dumb it is that people feel this burning desire to share their political beliefs on the internet.

It's not as though major political events just suddenly started happening either, rather, it's just that non-politics focused internet spaces had two unspoken rules, you didn't spoil things, and you didn't talk about politics. In recent years, though, the ladder rule has seemingly disappeared. 

If you go into any major internet space, be it Twitter, Reddit, Discord, whatever, you'll probably be able to find someone with 'Free [whatever war torn country is popular now]' in their bio or a flag of a country that they bare zero relation to in their username. These seemingly serve as invitations for whoever holds the opposing political beliefs to argue with them for seven hours, before coming to the conclusion that neither of them know what they're talking about.

I'm not trying to imply that political issues shouldn't be discussed, either, rather, that there's a time and place for it. Go argue over middle eastern wars on /pol/ instead of waving around your beliefs in a Discord server and then arguing in general chat.

I do think a large part of *why* this is happening stems from a demographic change, as, at least in my experience, most people currently over the age of 18 were raised to not discuss politics. Nowadays, though, literal twelve year olds can go on TikTok and get news from some random guy.

It's almost become a, with a lack of better word, hobby, in my eyes. A lot of the people engaging in this behavior are teenagers or younger, and because of the complete disconnect from reality caused from how they receive the information, it's just become arbitrarily picking sides. 

This analogy is god-awful, but it's honestly akin to how people argue about Intel VS. AMD, even though these are subject matters that effect the lives of countless people, and are far more complicated than picking a side and arguing. 

Basically, form your political beliefs, but maybe don't go waving them around and arguing, 99% of people don't want to hear or know. It's a lot easier to just keep quiet than to argue, anyways. If you actually want to make a difference, donate to charities, vote, or do literally anything other than "debating" over semantics.
