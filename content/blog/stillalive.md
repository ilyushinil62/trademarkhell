title: Sorry, I'm Not Dead Yet
description: I feel the need to post something on this site as everything is taking awhile, so bam, here you go, another random status update, I'll probably take this down once I get stuff up and running again.

It's been a bit, well, not really, but for this site it has been awhile. I haven't given up on this site just yet, ironically, it's because of this site that there's been nothing for awhile. I'm currently in the final stages of changing the layout for this site, because as of now it's the 2nd most generic site in the greater tri-webhost area. I've posted it in the Discord Server a few times, but I feel like it'd be dumb to spoil my own site here.

Article-Wise, I had the brilliant idea of starting work on an article that needs 200-something datapoints, but that should also be done later this week, it's probably the first semi-objective thing I've ever posted here. I'm not gonna say this site will come back better than ever, because it won't, but it'll come back.

Once I do get everything back up and running, my goals to get an article or two out a week, but it's the time of year where I actually have obligations to take care of, so no promises. Take care, don't do hard drugs, etc, etc. TM out.

(yeah i opened the folder for this site for the first time in a week just to write this, move along)
