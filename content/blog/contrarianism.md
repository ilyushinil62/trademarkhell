title: Contrarianism Is Just Hatred
description: Alternatively titled "The Death of Tim Shady". This article is based on the extremely scientific conclusion I came to after half a year of LARPing in Discord servers. You should know the deal by now, this is Harvard level research, and as such, I will cite none of my sources at all.

I've always been one of those people who view the internet as an elaborate RPG game, even though it happens to have real people; that's to say, I create characters. Usually, I just do this for leisure, but at times, I do this out of some strange sense of curiosity. 

Trademarkhell.net was originally created because of this curioisity, it was the product of me trying to create the complete opposite of what I saw on 'normal' personal sites. Thankfully, though, I moved on from this, and am now stuck with the domain 'trademarkhell.net' as a remnant until I finally get around to changing it. 

I didn't really learn all that much about contrarianism from the site itself; people don't often visit my site and speak ill of it. So, I replaced it with a Discord identity vaguely connected to it, a bespoke persona specifically tailored to be the opposite of the indie web user base. The indie web was filled with moralist teenagers, so it became an edgy teenager. The indie web was filled with Americans and Europeans, so it became Asian. The indie web was filled with leftists, so it became right-wing. The indie web was filled with tolerance, so it became filled with hate.

Every single aspect of this "character" was designed to the majority, regardless of what I personally agreed with or was. Yet, somehow, instead of being shunned as I expected it to be, as I hoped it to be, instead, it gained a following. My one man opposition to the general beliefs of an indie web Discord server turned into some overly grandiose multi-person conspiracy with connections to the Moderation of the server.

Even within this conspiracy, though, the only thing that united it was hate; the people within it and the persona I formulated didnâ€™t even share that much in common. The only thing they shared was a hatred for the majority. And this is exactly the issue with contrarianism: you're not being some kind of "based counter-culturist" who has genuine criticisms; you're just needlessly hating on people you disagree with when you could simply, I don't know, spend more time with people you agree with? 


Ultimately, this so-called experiment had a rather anti-climatic ending, I felt as though the "movement" I had formed grew far too much, so I simply disappeared into the night. I guess I should probably apologize to all the people I pissed off and got to leave the Discord server, but honestly, just as I'll probably never think of this identity again, they'll probably never think of it again. Discord isn't that serious, even it's fun to pretend as though it is. TM out.
