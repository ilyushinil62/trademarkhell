title: Indecisiveness and Web Design
description: God gives his best layout ideas to his most indecisive soldiers. This is basically just an article about how annoying it is to decide on literally anything for websites, and yes, there'll almost certainly be another layout in a few weeks.

If you haven't noticed by the fact that this website gets completely rebranded every month or two, I'm rather indecisive. I doubt it's just me, though, I mean I see plenty of sites get updated an absurd amount, and the 4,282 scrapped layouts that my friends make.

Webdesign is sort of a trap, in that by just publishing a layout, you'll immediately notice every flaw it has. Besides, you like doing web development, so you'll just remake it anyways, and so the cycle continues. 

The current layout you're looking at is the result of weeks of (off and on) work, and quite frankly, I don't like it at all. Everything on this site was the result of a concious decision, and yet, juat a week after publishing it, I've "decided" to not like it.

I honestly think it may be impossible to fully decide on a layout, or even a style, unless you make it as bland and inoffensive as possible. That's not to say that this is a good thing, but honestly, I think it's what'll come in the near future for me.

I put this so eloquently in a Discord conversation with someone who's name I won't bother to obscure, since it's some stupid esoteric nickname anyways.

Although, I think there's a beauty in a site that's simple and long-lasting. The backend of this site is genuinely atrocious, I think nearly all the stylesheets are over 500 lines, and that makes me want to simplify the site along with the stylesheets.

It's not a bad thing to always be changing layouts in some indecisive frenzy, but I don't think contentment will ever be reached until you make something absurdly simple and easy to tolerate.

I've always liked creative site designs, but by the end of November, there's no way this site isn't some soulless Helvetica font using, mobile-responsive, grey/white themed thing. Remember this article as the one that killed trademarkhell.net, I guess, but also consider that there's more to having a website than re-styling it every week. TM out.
